# DrJrDev Hackathon April 2023

## This hackathon challenged us to use Discord.js to create a bot to help the Dear Jr Dev community. We decided on a joke of the day bot. We picked this so that we could have a fun time building a simple project and focus on test cases. We'd love to hear your feedback.
